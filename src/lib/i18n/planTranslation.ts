 * require knowing the namespace at compile time. Listing the actual

 * callers don't sprinkle it across pages. Missing translations still surface
 * at runtime as next-intl's `MISSING_MESSAGE`.
 *
 * Parameter type `(key: never) => string` is assignable from any typed
 * translator — `never` is the bottom type, so a function that accepts a
 * specific literal union is assignable where one accepting `never` is
 * required. The `satisfies DynamicPlanKey` check on the template literal
 * keeps key construction honest without weakening the translator parameter.
