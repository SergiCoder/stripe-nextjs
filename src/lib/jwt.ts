 * `GET /account/` round-trip when only the user ID is needed (e.g. server
 * actions doing authorization checks against `OrgMember.user.id`).
 *
 * Returns `null` when no token is present or the payload is malformed; never
 * throws. Callers that require the user object must still call
 * `authGateway.getCurrentUser()`.
