# SaaSmint App

Next.js 16 SaaS frontend paired with `SaaSmint Core`.

## Architecture

Strict hexagonal layers:

| Layer          | Location                        | Can import                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Domain         | `src/domain/`                   | nothing external                                   |
| Application    | `src/application/`              | `domain/` only                                     |
| Infrastructure | `src/infrastructure/`           | `domain/`, `application/ports/`                    |
| Presentation   | `src/presentation/`, `src/app/` | `domain/`, `application/ports/`, `infrastructure/` |

**Never** import from `infrastructure/` inside `domain/` or `application/`.

`src/application/` currently contains only `ports/`. Server actions and `_data/` fetchers call gateways directly via `src/infrastructure/registry.ts` — port interfaces still provide the type contract for swapping implementations.

## Domain Models

Core types in `src/domain/models/`. All fields `readonly` — treat domain objects as immutable.

- `User` (`isVerified` — email confirmed; drives profile warning and login `email_not_verified` error with resend link), `Org`, `OrgMember` (`org` is nested `Org`; `user: { id, email, fullName, avatarUrl }` — use `member.user.id` for identity checks; role: `owner | admin | member`, `isBilling` flag), `Invitation` (`org` is nested `Org`; carries the invitee `email` and an `invitedBy` reduced to `{ id, fullName }`), `PublicInvitation` (unauthenticated `GET /invitations/{token}/` shape — drops `email` and any inviter email so a leaked token can't enumerate addresses), `PhonePrefix`
- `Plan` — `(context: personal|team, tier: 1=free|2=basic|3=pro, interval: month|year)` + `price: Price | null` (`null` for the synthesised personal-free card; backend returns paid plans only).
- `Price` — single domain type shared by `Plan.price` and `Product.price`. Fields: `id`, `amount`, `displayAmount`, `currency`, `localDisplayAmount: number | null`, `localCurrency: string | null`. The `local*` fields are set when the user's preferred currency differs from the billed currency; both are `null` when no conversion is available. Used by `buildPlanCardGroups` via the `formatPriceSubLabelLocal` callback (factory: `makeLocalSubLabelFormatter(t)`) to render a dual-currency sub-label, and by `buildProductPriceSubLabels` to build the `priceSubLabels` map for `ProductsGrid` / `ProductsCheckoutSection`.
- `Product` (one-time)
- `Subscription` — Stripe-mirrored row. `GET /billing/subscriptions/me/` returns a paginated envelope with 0–2 rows. Use `findPersonalSubscription()` / `findTeamSubscription()` to pick a row. `seatLimit` = purchased seat capacity (authoritative cap — do not hardcode a constant); `seatsUsed` = accepted members currently occupying seats. "Scheduled to cancel" UI = `cancelAt` is set; `canceledAt` only flips after the sub actually ends. `scheduledPlan` + `scheduledChangeAt` are set together when a downgrade is deferred to period end (upgrades apply immediately and leave both `null`); cleared when the user releases the schedule via `releaseScheduledChange()` or at `currentPeriodEnd` when the change applies automatically. Mutating endpoints accept `?context=personal|team` (required when both rows exist; backend defaults to `team` for org members, `personal` otherwise).
- `CreditBalance` — `{balance, scope: "user"|"org"}`; `balance` is constrained to a non-negative integer at the Zod boundary. `GET /billing/credits/me/` returns `{balances:[...]}`, 0–2 rows. Render in backend-provided order without re-sorting.

Domain errors in `src/domain/errors/`: `AuthError`, `BillingError`, `ApiError` (carries `status`, `body`, `detail` getter), `NetworkError` (carries `cause`). All have a `code: string`. `ApiError.code` resolution: explicit arg → `body.code` → `HTTP_<status>`. Server actions translate thrown errors via `toActionError()`; clients resolve codes through `actionErrors.<code>` next-intl namespace via `useActionErrorMessage`.

Static reference data lives in `src/domain/data/` as generated constants — not behind a gateway. `PHONE_PREFIXES` (`src/domain/data/phonePrefixes.ts`) is regenerated from the backend via `pnpm sync:phone-prefixes` (script in `scripts/sync-phone-prefixes.ts`); commit the diff. Use this pattern only for data that is effectively immutable and small enough to ship in the bundle.

## Infrastructure

`src/infrastructure/` organised by provider:

- `api/` — `DjangoApi*Gateway` classes calling Core via `apiFetch`
- `auth/cookies.ts` — JWT cookie management

Avatar uploads go through `POST /account/avatar/`; client-side compression via `src/lib/compressImage.ts` runs first.

Each gateway implements a port from `src/application/ports/`. **Import singletons from `src/infrastructure/registry.ts`** — never instantiate gateway classes directly.

### API client

`src/infrastructure/api/apiClient.ts` exposes five variants over a shared `raw()`:

- `apiFetch` / `apiFetchVoid` — require token; throw `AuthError("NO_SESSION")` if none.
- `apiFetchOptional` — send token if present, fall back to anonymous. If a sent token is rejected, falls back to a fresh anonymous call.
- `publicApiFetch` / `publicApiFetchVoid` — never send a token.

The four JSON variants always return `Record<string, unknown>` — they accept no generic parameter. Type the response by passing the parsed result through a Zod schema (see "Response parsing" below); never cast the raw JSON.

Non-OK normalization: `401` on authenticated → `AuthError`; everything else → `ApiError(status, body)`. Network failures → friendly "unreachable" error.

### Response parsing

Gateways never cast raw JSON to domain types:

1. `apiFetch(...)` returns `Record<string, unknown>` — no generic, no cast
2. `keysToCamel(raw)` (or `keysToCamelWithPrice` for Plan/Product, plus `flattenPhone` for User) in `caseTransform.ts`
3. `UserSchema.parse(...)` etc. from `schemas.ts` — Zod schemas `satisfies z.ZodType<DomainModel>`

Always validate through a schema for new endpoints; do not re-introduce generic casts.

Shared parsing helpers live in `src/infrastructure/api/parsers.ts`:

- `fetchCurrentUser()` — single source of truth for `GET /account/`; used by both `IAuthGateway.getCurrentUser` and `IUserGateway.getProfile` to avoid duplicating the fetch+parse pair.
- `makeParser(schema)` — factory for the standard snake→camel+Zod pattern; use for any gateway whose response doesn't need extra reshaping.
- `parsePaginated(raw, parseItem)` — validates a DRF-style `{ results: [...] }` envelope and maps each item through the caller's per-item parser. Used by list-endpoint gateways (plans, orgs, members, etc.) to avoid trusting untyped casts on paginated responses.
- Named parsers `parseOrg`, `parseMember`, `parseInvitation`, `parsePublicInvitation` built with `makeParser`. `parseUser` is also exported but uses a manual parse path because the User shape needs `flattenPhone` between camel-casing and Zod parsing.

### Env vars

Public env vars validated once at module load in `src/lib/env.ts` (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`). Validator is zod-free so `src/proxy.ts` can import it without pulling zod into the per-request proxy bundle. Each value is checked with `new URL(value)` at startup, so a non-URL value (e.g. a bare hostname missing a scheme) fails fast at boot rather than later inside a request handler. Import `env` from `@/lib/env` rather than reading `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_*` directly.

## Authentication

Django issues JWTs directly — no third-party provider.

- **Tokens**: access (15 min) + refresh (7 days) in HTTP-only secure cookies.
- **Login/Signup**: server actions call `POST /auth/login/`, `POST /auth/register/`. After registration the user is redirected to `/login?registered=true` — email must be verified before the first login. A failed login with code `email_not_verified` surfaces a resend link via `ResendVerificationLink` (calls `resendVerificationEmail` action → `POST /auth/resend-verification/`; fire-and-forget, always returns success to avoid email enumeration). Email verification itself is `verifyEmail` action → `POST /auth/verify-email/`.
- **OAuth**: server action sets short-lived `oauth_in_progress` flow cookie + redirects to `GET /auth/oauth/{provider}/`. Django redirects back to `/auth/callback#code=<opaque>`. Client strips fragment via `history.replaceState` and calls `exchangeOAuthCode` server action → `POST /auth/oauth/exchange/`. Post-login redirect targets validated against an allowlist (`src/lib/oauthNext.ts`).
- **OAuth cross-provider linking**: when a second OAuth provider returns an email matching an existing account under unverified-trust conditions (e.g. Microsoft without `xms_edov`), the Django callback emails the existing account a single-use confirmation link landing on `/auth/link-email-sent` first, then `/auth/confirm-link?token=…`. `ConfirmLinkClient` requires a manual button click (never auto-POSTs — email-scanning bots like Outlook Safe Links pre-fetch URLs and would burn the single-use token) and calls `confirmOAuthLink` action → `POST /auth/oauth/confirm-link/`, which mints the same token envelope as `/auth/oauth/exchange/`. No `oauth_in_progress` cookie is required (the click typically happens in a different session/device), so success redirects to `/dashboard` rather than a stored `next`. The legacy `oauth_email_unverified_collision` error code is kept in the auth-error passthrough set as defense-in-depth against stale links.
- **Proxy (`src/proxy.ts`)** — the Next.js request interceptor formerly named `middleware` (renamed to the `proxy` convention in Next 16; defaults to the Node.js runtime). On routes that read the session user, decodes the access token JWT via `decodeJwtPayload` (`src/lib/jwtDecode.ts` — pure base64+JSON, no Zod, Edge-safe), refreshes via `POST /auth/refresh/` when expired/missing. Anonymous-only routes skip the refresh. When the refresh call itself is rejected (Django 4xx or malformed body), clears stale cookies on both the incoming request and the outgoing response. Forwards pathname as `x-pathname` (`PATHNAME_HEADER`) and a per-request CSP nonce as `x-csp-nonce` (`CSP_NONCE_HEADER`) — both defined in `src/lib/pathname.ts`. Pathname is read via `getPathname()` / `getPathnameWithoutLocale()` / `getLocale()`; nonce via `getCspNonce()` (for server components that inject inline scripts). The matcher excludes `/api/*` — any future route handlers under `src/app/api/` bypass the proxy entirely (no CSP nonce, no `x-pathname`, no token refresh) and must implement their own auth checks.
- **Locale-prefixed redirects**: always use a locale-prefixed path — `redirect(`/${locale}/dashboard`)` not `redirect("/dashboard")`. A bare redirect strips the locale segment, breaking the next-intl router and causing a client-side hydration mismatch on cross-redirect chains. In **server actions** obtain the locale with `const locale = await getLocale()` (from `@/lib/pathname`), which reads the `x-pathname` header forwarded by the proxy and falls back to the default locale when absent. In **page components** and **layouts**, the locale is already available from `await params` — use it directly.
- **`NEXT_LOCALE` cookie sync**: next-intl's own middleware writes the `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie automatically on every locale-redirect response. The `(app)` layout does **not** write this cookie directly — `cookies().set()` throws outside a Server Action or Route Handler context (a layout render is neither). The redirect the layout issues when `user.preferredLocale !== locale` lands on a URL that next-intl's middleware then processes, which is where the cookie gets updated. Do not clear this cookie on sign-out.
- **API calls**: `apiClient.ts` reads `access_token` cookie, sends `Authorization: Bearer`.

## Component Design

Atomic structure in `src/presentation/components/`: `atoms/`, `molecules/`, `organisms/`, `templates/`. Flat files (`atoms/Button.tsx`, no folder-per-component); one barrel `index.ts` per level.

- Tailwind v4 utility classes only; design tokens in `src/app/globals.css` via `@theme`.
- Components receive all user-facing text as props — no hardcoded strings.
- Server Components by default; `"use client"` only for interactivity.
- For raw form elements (`<select>`, `<textarea>`, inline `<input>`) that can't use the `Input` atom, import `INPUT_DEFAULT_CLASS` from `atoms/Input.tsx` (the pre-composed default-state class) rather than duplicating the class string. Use `INPUT_BASE_CLASS` + `INPUT_BORDER_ERROR` only for the error state.

## Server Actions

In `src/app/actions/` (one file per area). Each action calls gateways directly from the registry and returns `ActionResult<T>` from `src/lib/actions/ActionResult.ts`:

- `ok()` / `ok(data)` — success.
- `fail(code, { fieldErrors? })` — failure with stable string code; clients resolve human messages via i18n on `code`, so no message parameter is exposed.
- `toActionError(err)` — maps thrown gateway errors to `fail(...)`.

Form parsing uses `src/lib/actions/parseFormData.ts` (`getString`, `getNonEmptyString`, `getInt`, `getFile`).

Actions `console.error` the raw error (including `ApiError.body`) before returning so server logs retain backend payloads while clients only see stable codes.

When an action only needs the current user's ID (e.g. for a role check against a membership list), call `getCurrentUserIdFromCookie()` from `src/lib/jwt.ts` instead of `authGateway.getCurrentUser()` — the middleware has already verified token expiry, so the full `GET /account/` round-trip is unnecessary. `src/lib/jwt.ts` is a thin wrapper around `decodeJwtPayload` from `src/lib/jwtDecode.ts`; both modules deliberately stay zod-free so they're safe to import from Edge contexts.

Co-located `_data/` fetchers also call gateways directly and are wrapped in `React.cache()`.

## Route Groups

`src/app/[locale]/`:

- `(marketing)/` — public pages, `MarketingLayout`
- `(auth)/` — login/signup/etc., `AuthLayout`
- `(app)/` — authenticated, `AppLayout`
- `(public)/` — unauthenticated public (invitation acceptance)
- `auth/` — OAuth flow pages with no shared layout: `callback/` (code exchange), `confirm-link/` (cross-provider account linking), `link-email-sent/`, `error/`

Route-specific clients in co-located `_components/`; shared server fetchers in `_data/` (cached).

## Key Rules

- App Router only — no `pages/`.
- No raw `fetch` in components — go through a server action or `_data/` fetcher.
- Auth: Django JWT in `Authorization: Bearer` (read from HTTP-only cookie).
- Payments: Stripe-hosted surfaces only — no embedded forms. First-time subscriptions use Checkout; plan changes for existing subscribers use `changePlan` server action (`PATCH /billing/subscriptions/me/`) — upgrades apply immediately, downgrades defer to period end. The Billing Portal (`openBillingPortal` action, `BillingPortalButton` component) is for payment method management and invoices only.
- All user-facing strings through next-intl.
- Brand color: teal `#0D9488` (`primary-600`).
- TS `strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noImplicitReturns`, `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch` — narrow indexed access instead of using `!`.

## Committing

Always use `/commit`. Never commit manually. Do **not** add `Co-Authored-By:` trailers (or any other AI attribution) to commit messages — keep authorship clean.

## Running

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev         # https://localhost:3000 (Turbopack, --experimental-https)
```

Dev server reads root CA + localhost certs from `../saasmint-core/infra/certs/` — clone both repos side-by-side.

## Testing

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm test:coverage
```

Tests in `tests/` mirror `src/` (Vitest; config in `vitest.config.ts`).

### Global fixtures (`tests/setup.ts`)

- **`next-intl` stub** — `useTranslations()` echoes the i18n key when called without params, substitutes `{param}` placeholders with a params object (unused params appended). `useLocale()`→`"en"`, `useMessages()`→`{}`.
- **`@/lib/i18n/navigation` stub** — `Link` renders plain `<a>`; routing helpers are no-ops.
- **`console.error` silenced** via `vi.spyOn` in `beforeEach`. Read calls via `vi.mocked(console.error)` to assert on logging.
- **DOM cleanup** — `afterEach(cleanup)`.

### Component testing

- `Button` exposes `variant`/`size` as `data-variant` / `data-size` — prefer those over class-name matching.
- Assert on interpolated values from the i18n stub, not on key names.
